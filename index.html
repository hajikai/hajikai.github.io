                        <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed
                            to
                            be displayed
                            in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
                            and
                            scripting
                            languages such as JavaScript.

                            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the
                            documents into
                            multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
                            included cues for
                            the appearance of the document.

                            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
                            objects such as
                            interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
                            structured documents
                            by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
                            and
                            other items.
                            HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and
                            input
                            directly
                            introduce content into the page. Other tags such as "p" surround and provide information
                            about
                            document text
                            and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use
                            them
                            to interpret
                            the content of the page.

                            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects
                            the
                            behavior and
                            content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
                            Wide
                            Web Consortium
                            (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has
                            encouraged
                            the use of
                            CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</p>

                    <div class="teksti">
                        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
                            of a
                            document
                            written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World
                            Wide
                            Web, alongside
                            HTML and JavaScript.[2]

                            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout,
                            colors,
                            and fonts.[3]
                            This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in
                            the
                            specification
                            of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
                            the
                            relevant CSS
                            in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content;
                            and
                            enable the
                            .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file
                            and
                            its
                            formatting.

                            Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page
                            in
                            different
                            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via
                            speech-based
                            browser or
                            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate
                            formatting if the
                            content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]

                            The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule
                            applies if more than
                            one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.

                            The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media
                            type (MIME type)
                            text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free
                            CSS
                            validation
                            service for CSS documents.[5]

                            In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain
                            XML,
                            SVG, and XUL.
