                        <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first
                            front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design
                            templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
                            As of August 2021, Bootstrap is the tenth most starred project on GitHub, with over 152,000
                            stars, behind freeCodeCamp (over 328,000 stars), Vue.js framework, React library, TensorFlow
                            and others.</p>
                        <h4>History</h4>
                        <strong>Early beginnings</strong>
                        <p>Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton
                            at Twitter as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap,
                            various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a
                            high maintenance burden. According to Twitter developer Mark Otto:

                            A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool
                            and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build
                            something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with
                            an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and
                            assets within the company.

                            After a few months of development by a small group, many developers at Twitter began to
                            contribute to the project as a part of Hack Week, a hackathon-style week for the Twitter
                            development team. It was renamed from Twitter Blueprint to Bootstrap, and released as an
                            open source project on August 19, 2011. It has continued to be maintained by Mark Otto,
                            Jacob Thornton, and a small group of core developers, as well as a large community of
                            contributors.</p>
                        <h4>Features</h4>
                        <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of
                            informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web
                            project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As
                            such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their
                            liking. Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML
                            elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web
                            browsers. In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to
                            further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned
                            for light- and dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with
                            a highlight.

                            Bootstrap also comes with several JavaScript components in the form of jQuery plugins. They
                            provide additional user interface elements such as dialog boxes, tooltips, and carousels.
                            Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases
                            accompanying JavaScript code. They also extend the functionality of some existing interface
                            elements, including for example an auto-complete function for input fields.

                            The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an
                            entire web page. The basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in
                            the page is placed in it. Developers can choose between a fixed-width container and a
                            fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the width of the web page, the former
                            uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, depending on the size of the screen showing
                            the page:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Smaller than 576 pixels</li>
                            <li>576–768 pixels</li>
                            <li>768–992 pixels</li>
                            <li>992–1200 pixels</li>
                            <li>Larger than 1200 pixels</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once a container is in place, other Bootstrap layout components implement a CSS Flexbox
                            layout through defining rows and columns.

                            A precompiled version of Bootstrap is available in the form of one CSS file and three
                            JavaScript files that can be readily added to any project. The raw form of Bootstrap,
                            however, enables developers to implement further customization and size optimizations. This
                            raw form is modular, meaning that the developer can remove unneeded components, apply a
                            theme and modify the uncompiled Sass files.</p>
