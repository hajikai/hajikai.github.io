      <h2>About this page</h2>
      <p>This is my website about modern computer processors and the two gigantic techonology firms trying to outcompete
        in today's fast-advancing market.
        <br>You can find more information on these two companies, AMD and Intel, on their own pages or by scrolling futher down on this page.
      <br><br>
      But first, let's explain some basic details about processors or central processing units (CPUs) as they are commonly known.
      </p>
      <h3>First, what is a processor?</h3>
      <p>A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor, main processor or just processor, is the
        electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic
        arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program.
        This contrasts with external components such as main memory and I/O circuitry, and specialized processors such
        as graphics processing units (GPUs).
        <br><br>
        The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over time, but their fundamental operation remains
        almost unchanged. Principal components of a CPU include the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) that performs arithmetic
        and logic operations, processor registers that supply operands to the ALU and store the results of ALU
        operations, and a control unit that orchestrates the fetching (from memory), decoding and execution of
        instructions by directing the coordinated operations of the ALU, registers and other components.
        <br><br>
        Most modern CPUs are implemented on integrated circuit (IC) microprocessors, with one or more CPUs on a single
        metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) IC chip. Microprocessors chips with multiple CPUs are multi-core processors. The
        individual physical CPUs, processor cores, can also be multithreaded to create additional virtual or logical
        CPUs.
        <br><br>
        An IC that contains a CPU may also contain memory, peripheral interfaces, and other components of a computer;
        such integrated devices are variously called microcontrollers or systems on a chip (SoC).
        <br><br>
        Array processors or vector processors have multiple processors that operate in parallel, with no unit considered
        central. Virtual CPUs are an abstraction of dynamical aggregated computational resources.
      </p>
      <h3>Who are the two giants?</h3>
      <p>The AMD vs Intel battle still persists, with no one manufacturer coming out the one true winner. That’s great news for us consumers. This intense rivalry continues to gift us the best processor for gaming, creative workloads, and casual use, giving us a whole lot more options to choose from at every price point.
        <br><br>
        This also means, however, that choosing between AMD and Intel is much harder. Luckily, you don’t necessarily have to choose one over the other. Both have their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as excellent CPUs on offer catering to every need and budget. Still, as this is strictly an Intel vs AMD faceoff, it's important to know where each manufacturer's strengths lie, especially in terms of price, overclocking abilities, graphics, and component variety. That way, you can choose wisely.
        <br><br>
        So, let’s dive right in. Whether you’re building a computer or simply upgrading the gaming PC you already have, we’ll help you make sense of it all by comparing the two and sorting out how the AMD Ryzen 5000 series chips (and their predecessors) are different from Intel’s latest Tiger Lake and Rocket Lake chips (and their 10th-generation counterparts). We’ll also discuss where each brand is headed in the coming years.

              <p class="card-text">Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company
                headquartered in Santa Clara, California. It is the world's largest semiconductor chip manufacturer by
                revenue,[3][4] and is the developer of the x86 series of microprocessors, the processors found in most
                personal computers (PCs). Incorporated in Delaware,[5] Intel ranked No. 45 in the 2020 Fortune 500 list
                of the largest United States corporations by total revenue for nearly a decade, from 2007 to 2016 fiscal

              <p class="card-text">Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company
                based in Santa Clara, California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for
                business and consumer markets. While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later
                outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as going fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in
                2009. AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and
                graphics processors for servers, workstations, personal computers and embedded system applications</p>
