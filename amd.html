      <h4>AMD</h4>
      <p>This is the website's section about AMD - Intel's main competitor. Welcome.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <h4>Basic facts</h4>
        <div class="col-lg-8">
          
          <p>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American multinational semiconductor company based in Santa Clara,
            California, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets.
            While it initially manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a
            practice known as going fabless, after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include
            microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and graphics processors for servers,
            workstations, personal computers and embedded system applications.</p>
          <h4>First twelve years</h4>
          <p>Advanced Micro Devices was formally incorporated by Jerry Sanders, along with seven of his colleagues from
            Fairchild Semiconductor, on May 1, 1969. Sanders, an electrical engineer who was the director of marketing
            at Fairchild, had, like many Fairchild executives, grown frustrated with the increasing lack of support,
            opportunity, and flexibility within the company. He later decided to leave to start his own semiconductor
            company. Robert Noyce, who had developed the first silicon integrated circuit at Fairchild in 1959, had left
            Fairchild together with Gordon Moore and founded the semiconductor company Intel in July 1968.
            <br><br>
            In September 1969, AMD moved from its temporary location in Santa Clara to Sunnyvale, California. To
            immediately secure a customer base, AMD initially became a second source supplier of microchips designed by
            Fairchild and National Semiconductor. AMD first focused on producing logic chips. The company guaranteed
            quality control to United States Military Standard, an advantage in the early computer industry since
            unreliability in microchips was a distinct problem that customers – including computer manufacturers, the
            telecommunications industry, and instrument manufacturers – wanted to avoid.
            <br><br>
            In November 1969, the company manufactured its first product: the Am9300, a 4-bit MSI shift register, which
            began selling in 1970. Also in 1970, AMD produced its first proprietary product, the Am2501 logic counter,
            which was highly successful. Its best-selling product in 1971 was the Am2505, the fastest multiplier
            available.
            <br><br>
            In 1971, AMD entered the RAM chip market, beginning with the Am3101, a 64-bit bipolar RAM. That year AMD
            also greatly increased the sales volume of its linear integrated circuits, and by year-end the company's
            total annual sales reached US$4.6 million.
